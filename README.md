# ETG-YAWNING-DETECTION-USING-DLIB-PYTHON-LIBRARY

### PYTHON CODE FOR YAWNING DETECTION USING PYTHON DLIB LIBRARY

- Yawning detection has a variety of important applications in driver fatigue detection, well-being assessment of humans, driving behaviour monitoring, operator attentiveness detection, and understanding the intentions of a person with a tongue disability
- In this project, at first the webcam is activated using opencv-python library
- Then, the facial landmarks are obtained on the face that appears on the webcam using dlib library functions and shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file
- Finally, the landmarks for mouth is separated from the entire facial landmarks and those separated points are tracked to detect Yawning

-----

### FEATURES

- Detecting the Real-Time Frame(image) using opencv-python library
- Detecting the Facial Landmarks
- Yawning Detection
